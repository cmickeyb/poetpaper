\input{introduction.tex}
% goal open population of validators
% threat model

\input{priorart.tex}

\input{poet.tex}
% basic poet algorithm indenpdent of the enclave
% initialization/slow start
% flow control: create timer, when timer expires, create cert, verify cert
% configuration parameters
% population dynamics with computation of local mean
% handling forks, single block selection, multiple block
% chains... largest aggregate local mean, rationale for why this works
% evaluation of local mean adaptation

\input{enclave.tex}
% high level description of the enclave interface
% signup phase, create wt, create wc, verify wc
% enclave evaluation... various attacks and the solutions

% Naive approach to validation results in horrible performance. Added
% signup phase to offload validation, implications for revocation

% dependence on ME for time; the threat for attacks. Not really a
% problem since the tie breaker ensures correctness and progress. But
% important for DOS prevention

% wait cert bound to a block --> blockhash, why we can do late binding
% by adding allowing one wait cert per wait timer (only get one chance,
% can't game wait cert creation by trying different blockhashes)
% wait cert bound to a validator --> validator public id in the blockhash
% multiple instances of an enclave --> monotonic counter in the signup info
% multiple signup attack --> validation policy requires N blocks before
% registration complete
% recourse: revocation....

Multiple instances of the enclave
Problem: Multiple instances of an enclave implies multiple votes
Solution: Bind the ID of a monotonic counter to the EPID pseudonym
during sign up 

Restarting the enclave repeatedly to get a better identity
Problem: Signature of the WC is used in the wait time computation
implies PSK/PPK pair can influence the wait time point of control 
Solution: Ledger implements policy to force multiple blocks to commit
before an identity ledger randomness prevents meaningful control

Late binding of transactions improves performance, but provides control point
Problem: Block hash is used in wait time computation implies TXN list can influence future wait time
Solution: At most one WC may be created for a WT

Wait Certificate can be lifted and placed in a different block
Problem: Separation of ledger and enclave identities allows WC to be lifted from the block
Solution: Bind WC to persistent ledger identity, not just enclave identity

\input{failure.tex}
% when enclave fails...
% failure models -- overclocked timer, compromised enclave
% basic approach: preserve liveness and correctness, sacrifice performance
% enclave identifier must be unique and persistent --> EPID pseudonym
% (in signup info)
% z test solution
% z test during initialization
% evaluation of z test solution
% open issues, can we get into ``deadlock''... small populations could
% be a problem but small populations are generally well known so
% confidence interval can be very generous

\input{evaluation.tex}
% experimental evaluation
% did it work... number of forks, resolution of forks
% local mean adaptation
% performance impact of compromised enclaves and overclocked timers
